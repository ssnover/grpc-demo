# grpc-demo

Some experiments with trying out grpc with Rust.

Note: In order to get code completion for rust-analyzer in vscode, you need to set the following in vscode `settings.json`: `"rust-analyzer.cargo.runBuildScripts": true`. According to this [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/6448), this should be on by default but maybe is disabled in the extension due to RCE possibilities.
